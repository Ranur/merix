1. Make sure that you have:
   -- 2x "Base module with voltage regulator"
   -- 2x "nRF24L01 Module With added Transmit Power Amplifier, Low Noise Receiver Preamplifier, External Antenna"
   -- 1x Arduino Uno
   -- 1x Arduino Mega
   
2. Connect the base mosules and teh nrf24's together
3. Connect one of the builde to arduino Uno and one of teh bundles to Arduino Mega

for Arduino Uno the pins are :

GND  - GND
VCC  - 5V ( Again make sure yiu are connecting the base module NOT the NRF24 directly - the NRF is 3.3v )
CE   - 8
CSN  - 10
SCK  - 13
MOSI - 11
MISO - 12


for Arduino Mega the pins are :

GND  - GND
VCC  - 5V ( Again make sure yiu are connecting the base module NOT the NRF24 directly - the NRF is 3.3v )
CE   - 8
CSN  - 53
SCK  - 52
MOSI - 51
MISO - 50

3. edit the following files
